# Smart-Traffic-Control-using-Raspberry-Pi

The aim of the project is to reduce traffic congestion in a 4-way intersection by detecting traffic density at each lane 
using cameras which are fixed above the intersection.After detection the traffic lights are timed to allow lanes having maximum 
traffic to relieve congestion at the earliest(Greater Green light duration) as compared to the other lanes.
This could not only help in time saving but aslo reduce pollution caused by vehicles being idle in a junction over a long time.
